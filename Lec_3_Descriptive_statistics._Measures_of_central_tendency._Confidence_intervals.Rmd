<h3>Variable types in statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>numeric</li>
<ul>
<li>interval (e.g. speed, time (MRT-mean reaction time in experiments), weight, age, sound frequency (F1, F2 in phonetics)) -- any number of data points in a given interval</li>
<li>natural numbers (e.g. number of occurrences in a corpus; number of authors who use this word; also age)</li>
</ul>
<li>scalar (e.g. Likkert scale: assess the phrase on a scale from 1... to 7) &mdash; we know the order but do not know the distance</li>
<li>nominal/categorical (e.g. grammatical categories of the verb; gender; place of birth; genre)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Measures of central tendency</h3>
<ul>
<li>(arithmetic) mean</li>
<li>median</li>
<li>quartiles</li>
<li>mode</li>
</ul>

```{r}
# Basic R:
mydata <- c(1,2,4,4,4,5,8,8,10,50)
mean(mydata)
```

```{r}
median(mydata)
```
```{r}
table(mydata)
```
```{r}
which.max(table(mydata))
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
data.frame(mydata) %>% 
ggplot(aes(mydata)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, colour="black", fill="darkgray")
```
<h3>Standard deviation</h3>
<p>If $\bar{x}$ is a mean of X { x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>,... x<sub>n</sub> } then we can calculate the difference between each point and the mean and take a sum of the squared diffs (which is called variance).</p>
$$var = ( x_1 - \bar{x} )^2 + ( x_2 - \bar{x} )^2 + ( x_3 - \bar{x} )^2 + ... + ( x_n - \bar{x} )^2$$
Standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance (is calculated in the same units as $x_1$...$x_n$).
$$sd = \sqrt{var}$$
```{r}
sd(mydata)
```
<h4>mtcars data</h4>
```{r}
head(mtcars$mpg) # miles per gallon

<h3>Confidence Interval</h3>
<p>Main question: based on a given sample, what can we infer about the population? <br />
If we have just a single sample, perhaps the best estimate of the average value would be the sample mean, usually denoted as $\bar{x}$ (pronounced as x_bar). If we take more samples, their mean would differ a little (or a lot). So, the question is, how uncertain we are of that point estimate. For example, we would like to be 95% sure that the mean of any taken sample will be within certain interval. <br />
For a known standard deviation, 
$$CI_{95\%} = \bar{x} \pm 1.96*\frac{sd}{\sqrt{n}}$$
given that the values in X are randomly distributed and independent of each other.</p>
Thus, we can say that there is only a 5% chance that the <b>confidence interval</b> excludes the mean of the population.<br />
CI can be shown at different confidence levels, for example 90%, 95% and 99%. The coefficients for the calcuating CI are the following: 1.645 for 90% CI, 1.96 for 95%, 2.326 for 98% CI, 2.576 for 99% CI.</p>
```{r}
unique(mtcars$vs) # vs is either V-engine or Straight-engine
mtcars %>%
  group_by(vs) %>%
  summarise(mean.mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd.mpg = sd(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
            n.mpg = n()) %>%
  mutate(se.mpg = sd.mpg / sqrt(n.mpg),
         lower.ci.mpg = mean.mpg - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n.mpg - 1) * se.mpg,
         upper.ci.mpg = mean.mpg + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n.mpg - 1) * se.mpg)

```
